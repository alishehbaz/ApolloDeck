# Network Driver

---

# Introduction
- A network driver is a software component that enables communication between a computer and a network.
- It is responsible for transmitting and receiving data packets over the network.
- The network driver is an essential component of the operating system, and it must be designed to work with the specific hardware it is intended to support.

# Network Interface Card (NIC)
- A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network.
- It provides the physical interface between the computer and the network.
- The NIC is responsible for transmitting and receiving data packets over the network.

# Network Device Driver
- A network device driver is a software component that enables communication between the operating system and the NIC.
- It provides an interface between the operating system and the NIC.
- The network device driver is responsible for configuring the NIC, transmitting and receiving data packets, and handling errors.

# Network Protocol Stack
- A network protocol stack is a set of protocols that enable communication between computers over a network.
- The protocol stack is organized into layers, with each layer responsible for a specific aspect of network communication.
- The layers of the protocol stack include the physical layer, data link layer, network layer, transport layer, and application layer.

# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different hosts.
- TCP is used by many applications, including web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.
- TCP uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection between two hosts before data transmission can begin.

# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a transport layer protocol that provides a connectionless, unreliable, and unordered delivery of data between applications running on different hosts.
- UDP is used by many applications, including online games, streaming media, and voice over IP (VoIP) applications.
- UDP does not provide error checking or flow control, making it faster but less reliable than TCP.

# Internet Protocol (IP)
- The Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol that provides the addressing and routing functions necessary for data to be transmitted across a network.
- IP is responsible for breaking data into packets, adding addressing information to each packet, and routing packets to their destination.
- IP is used by all network protocols, including TCP and UDP.

# Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
