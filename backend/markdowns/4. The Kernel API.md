# The Kernel API

---

# Introduction
- The kernel API is a set of functions that the kernel provides to user-space programs.
- These functions allow user-space programs to interact with the kernel and perform various operations.

# System Calls
- System calls are a way for user-space programs to request services from the kernel.
- The kernel provides a set of system calls that user-space programs can use to perform various operations.
- Examples of system calls include `fork`, `exec`, `open`, `read`, `write`, and `exit`.

# Process Management
- The kernel provides functions for managing processes, such as `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`.
- `fork` creates a new process by duplicating the calling process.
- `exec` replaces the current process image with a new process image.
- `wait` waits for a child process to terminate.

# File System
- The kernel provides functions for interacting with the file system, such as `open`, `read`, `write`, and `close`.
- `open` opens a file and returns a file descriptor.
- `read` reads data from a file into a buffer.
- `write` writes data from a buffer to a file.
- `close` closes a file descriptor.

# Memory Management
- The kernel provides functions for managing memory, such as `sbrk` and `mmap`.
- `sbrk` increases the size of the process's data segment.
- `mmap` maps a file or device into memory.

# Signals
- Signals are a way for processes to communicate with each other and with the kernel.
- The kernel provides functions for sending and receiving signals, such as `kill` and `signal`.
- `kill` sends a signal to a process.
- `signal` sets a signal handler for a process.

# Synchronization
- The kernel provides functions for synchronization, such as `mutex_init`, `mutex_lock`, and `mutex_unlock`.
- `mutex_init` initializes a mutex.
- `mutex_lock` locks a mutex.
- `mutex_unlock` unlocks a mutex.

# Conclusion
- The kernel API provides a set of functions that user-space programs can use to interact with the kernel and perform various operations.
- These functions include system calls, process management, file system, memory management, signals, and synchronization.
