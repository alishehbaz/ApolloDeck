# xv6 on RISC-V

---

# Introduction
- xv6 is a simple Unix-like operating system
- It is used for teaching purposes
- It is written in C and assembly language
- It runs on RISC-V architecture

# Booting xv6
- The boot loader is the first program that runs when the computer is turned on
- The boot loader loads the kernel into memory and starts it
- The kernel initializes the hardware and sets up the system
- The kernel then starts the first user program, which is usually the shell

# System Calls
- A system call is a request for a service from the operating system
- Examples of system calls include read, write, and fork
- System calls are implemented in the kernel
- User programs can make system calls by using a special instruction called a trap

# Processes
- A process is an instance of a running program
- The kernel keeps track of all the processes in the system
- Each process has its own memory space and set of registers
- Processes can communicate with each other using inter-process communication (IPC)

# Memory Management
- The kernel manages the memory of the system
- The kernel allocates memory to processes as needed
- The kernel uses virtual memory to map physical memory to each process
- The kernel uses page tables to keep track of the mapping

# File System
- The file system is a way of organizing and storing files on disk
- The file system is implemented in the kernel
- The file system provides a hierarchical directory structure
- The file system supports file permissions and ownership

# Shell
- The shell is a user program that provides a command-line interface to the operating system
- The shell reads commands from the user and executes them
- The shell can run other programs and scripts
- The shell supports input/output redirection and piping

# Conclusion
- xv6 is a simple operating system that is used for teaching purposes
- It provides a good introduction to operating system concepts
- It is written in C and assembly language and runs on RISC-V architecture
- It includes features such as system calls, processes, memory management, file system, and shell.
