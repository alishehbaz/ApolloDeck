# Booting a RISC-V Computer

- The RISC-V computer boots by executing code at a fixed address in memory
- The code at this address is called the **boot loader**
- The boot loader initializes the hardware and loads the operating system into memory

---

# The Boot Loader

- The boot loader is a small program that is loaded into memory by the computer's firmware
- The boot loader initializes the hardware and loads the operating system into memory
- The boot loader is responsible for setting up the environment for the operating system to run

---

# The Boot Process

- The boot process begins when the computer is powered on
- The firmware initializes the hardware and loads the boot loader into memory
- The boot loader initializes the hardware and loads the operating system into memory
- The operating system takes control and begins executing its own code

---

# The Firmware

- The firmware is a small program that is stored in non-volatile memory on the computer's motherboard
- The firmware initializes the hardware and loads the boot loader into memory
- The firmware is responsible for providing a basic interface between the hardware and the operating system

---

# The Boot Loader Code

- The boot loader code is responsible for initializing the hardware and loading the operating system into memory
- The boot loader code is written in assembly language and is very small
- The boot loader code is loaded into memory by the firmware and executed by the processor

---

# Initializing the Hardware

- The boot loader code initializes the hardware by setting up the processor, memory, and other devices
- The boot loader code sets up the processor by configuring the registers and enabling interrupts
- The boot loader code sets up the memory by configuring the memory controller and mapping the physical memory to virtual memory

---

# Loading the Operating System

- The boot loader code loads the operating system into memory by reading it from disk
- The boot loader code reads the operating system from disk using the file system driver
- The boot loader code loads the operating system into memory by copying it from disk to memory

---

# The Operating System

- The operating system takes control after the boot loader has finished executing
- The operating system initializes the hardware and provides a user interface
- The operating system is responsible for managing the computer's resources and running applications
