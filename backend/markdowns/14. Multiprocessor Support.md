# Multiprocessor Support

---

# Introduction
- xv6 supports multiprocessor systems
- Multiprocessor systems have multiple CPUs
- Each CPU has its own set of registers and can execute instructions independently
- xv6 uses a spinlock to synchronize access to shared data structures

---

# Spinlocks
- A spinlock is a lock that a CPU can acquire by spinning in a loop
- If the lock is already held by another CPU, the spinning CPU waits until the lock is released
- Spinlocks are used to synchronize access to shared data structures
- Example: `acquire(&lk)` and `release(&lk)` functions in xv6

---

# Atomic Operations
- An atomic operation is an operation that is executed as a single, indivisible unit
- Atomic operations are used to synchronize access to shared data structures
- Example: `xchg` instruction in xv6, which atomically exchanges the value of a register with the value at a memory location

---

# Memory Barriers
- A memory barrier is a CPU instruction that enforces ordering of memory accesses
- Memory barriers are used to synchronize access to shared data structures
- Example: `__sync_synchronize()` function in xv6, which inserts a memory barrier

---

# Per-CPU Variables
- A per-CPU variable is a variable that has a separate copy for each CPU
- Per-CPU variables are used to avoid contention on shared data structures
- Example: `mycpu()` function in xv6, which returns a pointer to the current CPU's `struct cpu` structure

---

# Locking Granularity
- Locking granularity refers to the level of detail at which locks are used to synchronize access to shared data structures
- Fine-grained locking uses locks at a low level of detail, such as individual data structure elements
- Coarse-grained locking uses locks at a high level of detail, such as entire data structures
- xv6 uses a mixture of fine-grained and coarse-grained locking

---

# Conclusion
- Multiprocessor support in xv6 is achieved through the use of spinlocks, atomic operations, memory barriers, and per-CPU variables
- Locking granularity is an important consideration when designing synchronization mechanisms for multiprocessor systems
- xv6 uses a mixture of fine-grained and coarse-grained locking to achieve good performance and scalability
