# Page Tables

# What are Page Tables?
- Page tables are data structures used by the operating system to keep track of the mapping between virtual addresses used by a process and the physical addresses of the memory.
- They are used to implement virtual memory, which allows processes to use more memory than is physically available in the system.
- Page tables are typically implemented as a tree-like structure, with each node representing a page table entry (PTE).

# Types of Page Tables
- Single-level page tables: In this type of page table, all the page table entries are stored in a single table.
- Two-level page tables: In this type of page table, the page table entries are divided into two levels. The first level contains pointers to the second level, which contains the actual page table entries.
- Multi-level page tables: In this type of page table, the page table entries are divided into multiple levels. Each level contains pointers to the next level, until the final level contains the actual page table entries.

# Page Table Entry (PTE)
- A page table entry (PTE) is a data structure that contains information about a single page of memory.
- Each PTE contains a physical address of the page, a valid/invalid bit, and various other flags.
- The valid/invalid bit is used to indicate whether the page is currently in memory or not.

# Page Faults
- A page fault occurs when a process tries to access a page that is not currently in memory.
- When a page fault occurs, the operating system looks up the corresponding PTE in the page table to determine whether the page is valid or not.
- If the page is not valid, the operating system will load the page from disk into memory and update the page table accordingly.

# TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)
- The TLB is a cache of recently used page table entries.
- When a process tries to access a page, the operating system first checks the TLB to see if the corresponding PTE is already cached.
- If the PTE is in the TLB, the operating system can avoid the overhead of a page table lookup.

# Page Table Size
- The size of the page table depends on the size of the virtual address space and the page size.
- A larger virtual address space or a smaller page size will result in a larger page table.
- To reduce the size of the page table, the operating system
