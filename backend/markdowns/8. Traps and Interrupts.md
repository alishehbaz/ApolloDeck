# Traps and Interrupts

---

# What are Traps?
- Traps are software-generated interrupts that are caused by events occurring in the current process.
- Traps are used to handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of a program.
- Examples of traps include page faults, divide-by-zero errors, and system calls.

# How are Traps Handled?
- When a trap occurs, the processor saves the current state of the program and transfers control to the trap handler.
- The trap handler is a piece of code that is responsible for handling the specific trap that occurred.
- After the trap handler has finished executing, control is returned to the program at the point where the trap occurred.

# What are Interrupts?
- Interrupts are hardware-generated signals that are used to interrupt the normal execution of a program.
- Interrupts are used to handle events that occur outside of the current process, such as I/O operations or timer events.
- Interrupts can be handled by either the kernel or user-level code, depending on the type of interrupt.

# What is the Difference Between Traps and Interrupts?
- Traps are software-generated interrupts that are caused by events occurring in the current process.
- Interrupts are hardware-generated signals that are used to interrupt the normal execution of a program.
- Traps are used to handle errors and exceptions that occur during the execution of a program, while interrupts are used to handle events that occur outside of the current process.

# What is a System Call?
- A system call is a request made by a user-level program to the kernel for a service or resource.
- System calls are used to perform operations that require privileged access, such as I/O operations or memory management.
- Examples of system calls include read(), write(), and fork().

# How are System Calls Handled?
- When a user-level program makes a system call, the processor switches from user mode to kernel mode.
- The kernel then handles the system call and returns the result to the user-level program.
- After the system call has been completed, the processor switches back to user mode and
