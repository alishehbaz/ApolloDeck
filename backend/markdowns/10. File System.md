# File System

# File System Overview
- A file system is a way to organize data on a disk
- xv6 uses a simple file system called FFS (Fast File System)
- FFS divides the disk into blocks and uses inodes to keep track of files
- Each inode contains metadata about a file, such as its size and location on disk
- Directories are special files that contain a list of filenames and their corresponding inodes

# Inodes
- An inode is a data structure that contains metadata about a file
- In xv6, each inode is 64 bytes and contains the following information:
  - File type (directory, regular file, etc.)
  - File permissions (read, write, execute)
  - Number of links to the file
  - Size of the file in bytes
  - Block addresses for the file's data
- Inodes are stored in a fixed location on disk and are accessed using their inode number

# Directories
- A directory is a special file that contains a list of filenames and their corresponding inodes
- Directories are organized like a tree, with the root directory at the top
- Each directory entry consists of a filename and an inode number
- Directories can be nested to create a hierarchy of files and directories
- The "." and ".." entries in a directory refer to the current directory and its parent directory, respectively

# File Operations
- The file system provides several operations for manipulating files:
  - Create: create a new file with a given name and permissions
  - Open: open an existing file for reading or writing
  - Read: read data from a file into a buffer
  - Write: write data from a buffer to a file
  - Seek: change the current position in a file
  - Close: close an open file
- These operations are performed using system calls, such as open() and read()

# File Allocation
- Files are stored on disk in blocks, which are typically 4KB in size
- FFS uses a bitmap to keep track of which blocks are free and which are in use
- When a file is created, the file system allocates one or more blocks to store its data
- As the file grows, more blocks are allocated as needed
- When a file is deleted, its blocks are marked as free in the bitmap
