# System Calls

---

# What are System Calls?
- System calls are the interface between user-level programs and the operating system.
- They provide a way for user-level programs to request services from the operating system.
- System calls are typically invoked using a software interrupt or trap instruction.

---

# Types of System Calls
- Process control: fork, exit, wait, exec
- File management: open, read, write, close
- Device management: ioctl, read, write
- Information maintenance: getpid, time, sleep

---

# Process Control System Calls
- fork: creates a new process by duplicating the calling process
- exit: terminates the calling process
- wait: waits for a child process to terminate
- exec: replaces the current process image with a new process image

---

# File Management System Calls
- open: opens a file and returns a file descriptor
- read: reads data from a file
- write: writes data to a file
- close: closes a file descriptor

---

# Device Management System Calls
- ioctl: performs device-specific operations
- read: reads data from a device
- write: writes data to a device

---

# Information Maintenance System Calls
- getpid: returns the process ID of the calling process
- time: returns the current time
- sleep: suspends the calling process for a specified number of seconds

---

# Example: fork System Call
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    pid_t pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child process\n");
    } else if (pid > 0) {
        printf("Parent process\n");
    } else {
        printf("Fork failed\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

# Example: open System Call
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd == -1) {
        printf("Open failed\n");
    } else {
        printf("File opened successfully\n");
        close(fd);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
