# Operating System Structures

---

# Kernel Overview
- The kernel is the core of the operating system
- It is responsible for managing system resources and providing services to user programs
- The kernel is loaded into memory at boot time and remains resident until the system is shut down
- Examples of kernel services include process management, memory management, and device drivers

---

# Process Management
- The kernel is responsible for creating and managing processes
- A process is an instance of a running program
- The kernel provides each process with its own virtual address space and manages the allocation of system resources
- Examples of system resources include CPU time, memory, and I/O devices

---

# Memory Management
- The kernel is responsible for managing the system's memory
- It provides each process with its own virtual address space
- The kernel manages the allocation and deallocation of memory and ensures that each process can access only its own memory
- Examples of memory management techniques include paging and segmentation

---

# Device Drivers
- The kernel is responsible for managing the system's devices
- A device driver is a software component that provides an interface between the kernel and a device
- The kernel provides a set of standard device driver interfaces that allow device drivers to be written independently of the specific hardware they control
- Examples of devices include disk drives, network interfaces, and printers

---

# System Calls
- A system call is a mechanism for user programs to request services from the kernel
- System calls provide a way for user programs to interact with the operating system
- Examples of system calls include fork(), exec(), and open()
- System calls are typically implemented as software interrupts

---

# Interrupts and Traps
- An interrupt is a signal sent to the CPU by a device or other external event
- Interrupts are used to handle asynchronous events, such as I/O completion or timer expiration
- A trap is a software-generated interrupt that is used to transfer control to the kernel
- Traps are used to implement system calls and handle exceptions, such as page faults or illegal instructions

---

# Context Switching
- A context switch is the process of saving the state of a running process and restoring the state of a different process
- Context switching is necessary to allow multiple processes to run concurrently on a single CPU
- The kernel is responsible for managing context switches and ensuring that each process gets a fair share of CPU time
- Context switching can be expensive in terms of CPU time and
