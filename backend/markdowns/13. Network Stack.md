# Network Interface Card (NIC)
- A network interface card (NIC) is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network.
- It provides a physical interface for transmitting and receiving data over the network.
- NICs can be connected to a network using various physical media such as Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, or wireless signals.
- Examples of NICs include Ethernet cards, Wi-Fi adapters, and Bluetooth adapters.

# Network Protocols
- Network protocols are a set of rules and standards that govern communication between devices on a network.
- They define how data is transmitted, received, and processed by devices on the network.
- Examples of network protocols include TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and DNS.
- TCP/IP is the most widely used network protocol and is used for communication between devices on the internet.

# TCP/IP Protocol Suite
- The TCP/IP protocol suite is a collection of protocols that are used for communication between devices on the internet.
- It consists of four layers: the application layer, transport layer, internet layer, and link layer.
- The application layer includes protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS.
- The transport layer includes protocols such as TCP and UDP.
- The internet layer includes the IP protocol, which is responsible for routing data between devices on the internet.

# Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.
- It establishes a connection between two devices before transmitting data and ensures that all data is received correctly.
- TCP is used by applications such as web browsers, email clients, and file transfer programs.
- An example of a TCP connection is a web browser connecting to a web server to request a webpage.

# User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- UDP is a transport layer protocol that provides unreliable, unordered, and unchecked delivery of data between applications running on different devices.
- It does not establish a connection before transmitting data and does not ensure that all data is received correctly.
- UDP is used by applications such as online games, video streaming, and voice over IP (VoIP).
- An example of a UDP connection is a video streaming application transmitting video data to a user's device.

# Internet Protocol (IP)
- IP is an internet layer protocol that is responsible for routing data between devices on the internet.
- It provides a unique address, called an IP address, to each device
