# Processes

---

# Process Concept
- A process is an instance of a running program
- Each process has its own virtual CPU, memory, and I/O
- Processes are isolated from each other
- Processes communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC)

---

# Process State
- A process can be in one of three states: running, ready, or blocked
- Running: the process is currently executing on a CPU
- Ready: the process is waiting to be assigned a CPU
- Blocked: the process is waiting for some event to occur (e.g. I/O completion)

---

# Process Control Block (PCB)
- A data structure that contains information about a process
- Includes process state, CPU registers, memory management information, and more
- The operating system uses the PCB to manage processes

---

# Process Creation
- A new process is created by the fork() system call
- The new process is a copy of the parent process
- The new process has its own virtual CPU, memory, and I/O
- The new process starts executing at the same point as the parent process

---

# Process Termination
- A process can terminate itself by calling the exit() system call
- A process can be terminated by another process using the kill() system call
- When a process terminates, its resources are released and its PCB is removed from the system

---

# Process Scheduling
- The operating system decides which process to run next
- The scheduler selects a process from the ready queue
- The scheduler can use different algorithms to determine which process to run next (e.g. round-robin, priority-based)

---

# Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
- Processes can communicate with each other using IPC mechanisms
- Examples of IPC mechanisms include pipes, sockets, and shared memory
- IPC allows processes to share data and coordinate their activities

---

# System Calls
- A system call is a request for a service from the operating system
- Examples of system calls include fork(), exit(), and kill()
- System calls provide an interface between user-level programs and the operating system

---

# Conclusion
- Processes are the fundamental unit of execution in an operating system
- Processes are isolated from each other and communicate through IPC
- The operating system manages processes using PCBs and a scheduler
- System calls provide an interface between user-level programs and the operating system
